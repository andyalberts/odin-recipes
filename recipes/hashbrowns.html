    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too â€” especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes.</p>
    <p>Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</li>
        <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
